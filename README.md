Performed a comprehensive vulnerability scan on Power Pulse Utilities, an energy sector company, using Tenable. The scan identified three critical vulnerabilities that required immediate attention and resolution by the corresponding team.

Key Activities:

  1. Vulnerability Discovery: Conducted a detailed scan to uncover security weaknesses within the company's infrastructure.
  2. Impact and Mitigation: Analyzed the identified vulnerabilities to assess their impact and developed mitigation plans.
  3. Reporting: Generated a thorough assessment report for stakeholders, highlighting the vulnerabilities, their potential impact, and recommended remediation strategies.

This project showcased my ability to use Tenable for effective vulnerability assessment, management and reporting, contributing to the company's security improvements.
